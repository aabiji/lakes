ðŸŒŠ  Lake Water Level Tracker
Goal: Track and visualize water level changes in major Canadian lakes over time.

Tools: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib/Plotly), or JavaScript (D3.js)

Data Source: Environment and Climate Change Canada, Great Lakes Water Level data

Add-on ideas:

Predictive modeling using machine learning (e.g., seasonal forecasting with scikit-learn or TensorFlow)

Maybe we can visualize lake water levels over time to see how climate change is affecting lakes
